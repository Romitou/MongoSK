## ‚≠êÔ∏è What's new in 2.0?
A new major version of MongoSK is now available! Now let's take a look at what's new.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è **Database queries are executed asynchronously**<br/>
  *The code has been rewritten using the [mongodb-driver-reactivestreams](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-java-driver-reactivestreams) library*

- ‚öôÔ∏è **Automatic and intelligent transformation of all sorts of data**<br/>
  *You can now store all types of Skript as items, players, blocks, etc. MongoSK does the job for you!*

- üîä **Simple and understandable debugging to quickly identify problems**<br/>
  *The information are relevant and useful for both novice users and developers of the plugin*

- ü§ô **More logical and smart syntaxes**<br/>
  *Syntaxes have been reworked to be more consistent and logical*

‚ö†Ô∏è The support of the MongoSK 1 versions __will be dropped__ at March 31, 2021. We strongly recommend that you update. If you already have a script with MongoSK 1, you can find the update instructions on this [discussion](https://github.com/Romitou/MongoSK/discussions/23).
